        <p class="lead">Welcome to my website! This is a (likely personal) blog where I will document my progress as I develop new apps and programs. One of my friends convinced me to allow people to register and post here as well, so feel free to try it out. My goal is to continue this blog until I get hired as a software developer.</p>
